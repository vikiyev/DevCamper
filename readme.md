# DevCamper

A REST API built from scratch using Nodejs, Express and MongoDB integration. This API features middlewares for routing and authentication. This project is from Brad Traversy's course [Node.js API Masterclass With Express & MongoDB](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-api-masterclass/).

The API gives the user the ability to search, create, update or delete bootcamp/courses, read reviews and ratings. Authentication is done using JWT and cookies. Password encryption and preventing NoSQL injections and XSS are also considered. The documentation is created via Postman and docgen.
